VisKo
=====

The VisKo approach and resulting application programming interface (API) is founded on a visualization query language that was designed with the goal of hiding the associated complexities of visualization pipeline construction. By posing visualization queries, users can declaratively specify what visualizations they want generated from their data and quickly explore a variety of results that may only be generated using complex combinations of modules possibly supported across different toolkits.
The VisKo system described in this document provides a graphical user interface to the existing VisKo API as well as capabilities for managing statistical information regarding usage of the system.

Features

The following figure depicts a high-level use case diagram for the VisKo system. The use case diagram models the interactions between different actors, which are outside entities, and the system. Each oval describes a use of the system and the lines refer to actor interactions. The dashed boxes around use cases signify that each of those contained use cases are related to any other use case connected to the dashed box.
